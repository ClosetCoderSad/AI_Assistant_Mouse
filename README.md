This Python project leverages basic AI and ML techniques to create an assistant mouse, using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI modules. 
Users can control their mouse pointer with hand movements and perform actions such as selecting and left clicking.

Features:
- Hand Tracking: utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track hand movements in real-time
- Gesture Recognition: recognizes specific hand gestures such as "kissing" between index and thumb to perform mouse actions
- Mouse Control: uses PyAutoGUI to move the mouse pointer, select, and perform left-click actions.

Installation:
- clone the git repository
- install the three required dependencies modules

Usage:
- Ensure your webcam (internal or external) is connected and facing you
- Ensure there is no obstacle to conceal your hand movement
- Perform specific gestures (eg. pinch/kiss between index and thumb fingers)

Contributing:
- Contributions are welcome(I'll be working on it to include right click functionalities and improving the smoothness and UI)
